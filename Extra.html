<h2>GAMES</h2>	
	<h3>Minesweeper</h3>
	I played it pretty avidly the summer before last summer but almost stopped thinking about it after that summer passed. I got to know the game when I was in 
	elementary school and played it with my friends while always failing on the 99 bombs mode. Now I'm getting a bit better and can easily sweep the 40 bombs in 2 minutes. 
	The 99 bombs nightmare still stays there, but I feel good when trying to beat it at times.
	<h3>SET</h3>
	I got to know the game back in MOP when a lot of girls were talking about it. I tried it for some times but couldn't manage it even a bit. The game needs 
	a lot of practice and it's kinda fun when you are pretty fast. I still remembered how the game took me 20 minutes to finish one turn the first time. Time
	consuming but worth it.
	<h3>Chess</h3>
	My mom told me that I began playing chess from kindergarten... That's a rumor probably. Anyway the game is literally very fun (assuming you can remember 
	the rules of course) especially when you play it with strangers. I was stabbed by computers quite a lot of time but still tried to improve it by competing 
	with random guys in Lichess. Also people who use AI to win chess are bad oops.
	<h3>DST</h3>
	When I was young I played the copy version of DST and remembered getting killed by crazy beasts. Later I picked up the game because there was some person 
	who bought the game and granted me a copy. Playing it with friends is really fun (especially if there are only you two there), from dying in 3 days to 
	surviving 20 days, I've only got one lesson: DON'T CHOOSE WES (he's created because he wants you to fail).
	
<h2>Music</h2>
Maybe consider visiting my Chinese playlist <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6dwd44pm9RlPQa6g8vj9LO">here</a>.(I don't reckon it as a self-advertisement for the songs in my Chinese playlist are literally good)

	By the way, Icepaper is literally a genius rapper while Chris James is underestimated too. | “每年桃花开的时候，我就会想起一个人，他曾经很喜欢我。”
