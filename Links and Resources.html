<br>

GmathIRL helps improve the minds of youths through math courses and competitions held on two discord servers. 
	We've already successfully run two sessions (one focuses on Geometry and Calculus, the other helps our students better 
	prepare for AIME) and Rabbits Hunt is currently running in our private server. The GAME competition is also currenly going on!

Rabbit's Geometry: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FoEkea4L10_sxPdR8Pak2kJ_PQykXpvw/view?usp=sharing">The book</a>
<br>
<br>

The book mainly focuses on AIME and Olympiad level geometry with examples and problem sections. 
	First version has already been published with sketchy Geogebra pictures. 
	To improve its appearance, I'm working on the asymptote version nd have basically finished 80% chapter graphs thanks to Bratin Dasgupta.

Some sketchy handouts: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_H7pCBrNJxFXJ6ULT8NaS46OmwF_KGD3?usp=sharing">My early Geometry handouts</a>
<br>
Warning: These handouts are all my early handouts, which means they are pretty immature and sketchy.  
Think twice before you click.
<br>
<br>

Some good AIME problems: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-IbLQkl3OAXtJguWxBQK_bK_NEhsF1uh?usp=sharing">AIME preparation problems</a>
<br>
Credits go to people who pick these problems. Thanks to fellow math lovers who pick Algebra, Number Theory and Combinatorics.

Australian Math Competition Paper: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18EVyUKRdGJATQMBqNh4LJTjIEz-2FYcp?usp=sharing">AMC Senior 18-20</a>
<br>
Put them here so that people don't need to go to AMC's official website to spend 15 minutes adding these papers to their cart and pay $0.

MOP stuff: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DzxyVY_FvwhEJZUPxt5RQNTjHDOrg7yI/view?usp=sharing">2021 MOP homework</a>
	<br>
Since it is not internal use only, I don't see why not?

EGMO: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EjwkQKu1cHIuRPiPjys_1VVh45c-h5gr?usp=sharing">12-21 EGMO Problems</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pBOm0kaTi-TNHpf9mBUA3l2XnumA6mCV?usp=sharing">13,15-21 EGMO Solutions</a>
<br>
The reason I do this is the same as @2above I guess.
<br>
<br>
Note: The section problems and graph theory handouts for our Rabbits Hunt will be updated as soon as our session ends. For some ALP handouts I write, just go 
	to their Youtube channel and see my videos.
