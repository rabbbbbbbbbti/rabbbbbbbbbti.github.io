<H3>Links</h3>
GmathIRL: <a href = "https://gmathirl.webflow.io/">Our official website</a>
<br>
<br>

GmathIRL helps improve the minds of youths through math courses and competitions held on two discord servers. We've already successfully run one session and the other session is in progress right now. Events such as GAME and Rabbits Hunt are also under planning.

Rabbit's Geometry: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FoEkea4L10_sxPdR8Pak2kJ_PQykXpvw/view?usp=sharing">The book</a>
<br>
<br>

The book mainly focuses on AIME and Olympiad level geometry with examples and problem sections. First version has already been published with sketchy Geogebra pictures. To improve its appearance, I'm working on asy and have finished the first 3 chapters thanks to Bratin Dasgupta.

<H3>Resources</h3>
Some sketchy handouts: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_H7pCBrNJxFXJ6ULT8NaS46OmwF_KGD3?usp=sharing">My early Geometry handouts</a>
<br>
Warning: These handouts are all my early handouts, which means they are pretty immature and sketchy.  
Think twice before you click.
<br>
<br>

Some good AIME problems: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-IbLQkl3OAXtJguWxBQK_bK_NEhsF1uh?usp=sharing">AIME preparation problems</a>
<br>
Credits go to people who pick these problems. Thanks to fellow math lovers who pick Algebra, Number Theory and Combinactory.

Australian Math Competition Paper: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18EVyUKRdGJATQMBqNh4LJTjIEz-2FYcp?usp=sharing">AMC Senior 18-20</a>
<br>
Put them here so that people don't need to go to AMC's official website to spend 15 minutes adding these papers to their cart and pay $0.

<hr />
<H3>Chinese Section</h3>
This section is specially for people who can read Chinese or people who want to take math competitions in China. I upload these PDFs here so that people don't need to pay for expensive shipping fee. I claim that I get the copy right.

小蓝本（高中卷）数学奥林匹克小丛书1-14: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bi8ymYyzYUtzKeeGHJa4CSSKuO9tHKm6?usp=sharing">电子版</a>
<br>
奥数教程: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L1MUisP2kjtT9vLY3v1S3c_KxEen4xD8?usp=sharing">电子版</a>
<br>
These books mainly target at domestic grade 10-12 students who take math competitions. They are pretty popular domestically, and according to my own experience, they do help me a lot in cultivating logical thinking and proof writing skills. Hope y'all enjoy.
