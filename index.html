<li><a href="https://forms.gle/nsFm9PQ1fV5XreLu9">Register for our Math Club</a>
<li>We plan to hold a math club in the coming fall and winter mainly focusing on discussion AMC & AIME related topics. We will also hold a special session about 
	Graph Theory and its in real life applications related with dating (oops). It's kind of weird but that's what makes us unique! So please sign up if
	you are interested :D (Sad news: Serena is probably too packed in college applications so this will be delayed)
